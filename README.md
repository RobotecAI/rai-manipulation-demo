# Robotic Arm Manipulation Demo

This project demonstrates the use of [RAI](https://github.com/RobotecAI/rai) framework interfacing with a robotic arm in a simulation. In particular, it shows the communication between Generative AI models and the [Panda Franka](https://www.franka.de/) manipulator, which is a popular choice in AI and manipulation research in the robotic community. 

The simulation uses [O3DE](https://www.o3de.org/) game engine paired with [ROS 2 Gem](https://docs.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/interactivity/robotics/).

> **_NOTE:_**  This repository is not yet functional, as the demo is undergoing an internal review and development. The code will be fully usable and documented before [ROSCon 2024](https://roscon.ros.org/2024/).

## Demo description

The demonstration features a simulation of a robotic arm equipped with a gripper, which interacts with a multitude of objects that can be grasped, sorted, or manipulated based on instructions issued in the natural language. The RAI framework captures contextual information such as camera images and available command sets, subsequently translating these commands into ROS 2 messages to execute the arm's movements resolved by the Generative AI models.
